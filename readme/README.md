# SQL Portfolio â€“ Rockbuster Stealth Project

Welcome to my SQL project portfolio! This repository showcases the SQL queries and analyses I completed as part of Achievement 3 in the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Immersion program.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

The Rockbuster Stealth project analyzes data from a fictional global movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth. The goal was to answer key business questions and provide actionable insights to help the company compete with streaming services like Netflix.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Objectives

- Analyze customer behavior and rental patterns  
- Identify top-performing countries, cities, and customers  
- Provide recommendations for improving customer engagement and revenue  
- Write clean, well-documented SQL queries using joins, subqueries, CTEs, and aggregations

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following SQL scripts:

- `joins.sql` â†’ Demonstrates INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN to combine customer, payment, rental, and film data  
- `ctes.sql` â†’ Uses Common Table Expressions to organize complex queries and improve readability  
- `subqueries.sql` â†’ Includes subqueries for calculating metrics like top countries, most common film ratings, and high-value customers  
- `aggregations.sql` â†’ Shows use of aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG) to summarize rental and payment data  
- `window_functions.sql` â†’ (Optional) If applicable, highlights ranking and windowed analysis across customer segments

Each script includes comments explaining the purpose and logic of the query.
