# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL project portfolio! This repository showcases some of the SQL queries and analyses I completed as part of Achievement 3 in the CareerFoundry Data Analytics Immersion program.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project involved analyzing data from [INSERT DATASET NAME HERE, e.g., Rockbuster Stealth data set], a [briefly describe dataset: e.g., fictional movie rental company database] to answer key business questions and generate actionable insights.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Objectives

- Write clean, well-structured SQL queries  
- Perform data cleaning and transformation  
- Run aggregate functions, joins, CTEs, and subqueries  
- Provide insights to inform business decisions

## ðŸ—‚ Repository Structure

This repository contains the following SQL scripts:

- `joins.sql` â†’ Queries using INNER, LEFT, RIGHT joins  
- `ctes.sql` â†’ Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- `subqueries.sql` â†’ Examples of subqueries in SELECT, WHERE, and FROM clauses  
- `aggregations.sql` â†’ Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) with GROUP BY  
- `window_functions.sql` â†’ Queries using window functions (if applicable)

Each script includes comments explaining the logic and purpose of the query.
