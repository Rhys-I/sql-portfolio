# USSTHPI ARIMA Forecasting Project

This project uses the ARIMA model to forecast U.S. housing price trends based on the **U.S. All-Transactions House Price Index (USSTHPI)**.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib
- Statsmodels (ARIMA)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Key Visual

## 🧠 What I Did
- Cleaned and visualized housing price data over time
- Split into training and test sets
- Built and tuned an ARIMA model
- Forecasted future housing prices and compared against actual test data

## 📁 Files Included
- `USSTHPI_Time_Series_Analysis.ipynb`: Full analysis and modeling notebook
- `arima_forecast_vs_actual_full.png`: Forecast visualization

## 📌 Outcome
This project demonstrates practical use of ARIMA forecasting in a real-world housing dataset and improved my understanding of time series modeling in Python.
